# Compiling GSI, WPS + setting up conda 
last updated: Nov 24 2024

This repository contains information on "setting up" the executables + tools you need to run GSI on savio. Theroetically you could just copy the executables from my/Sienna's folder, but you will need to set up the conda environment yourself at a minimum, and it's good practice to try setting this all up yourself anyways. Most of this is pretty straightforward -- there's only a few steps that are quite involved. 


# 1. Install a local version of spack. You need to put this in scratch if your home directory is low on space!!! Clone the spack git directory into a nearby folder:

        $ git clone https://github.com/spack/spack
   
Note the path of this directory. You will assign it to the variable  

     $ path2spack=/global/scratch/users/siennaw/gsi_2024/compiling/spack

in the next two shell scripts. 

2. Install needed libraries using spack. You should open this script and edit the path2spack mentioned above. You can either run the shell script 

            $ ./1_install_GSI_packages.sh 

or submit to to slurm with 

            $ sbatch 1_install_GSI_packages.sh
            
From what I can tell, this script takes maybe ~60ish min to run when I used sbatch.

# 2. Download GSI from the internet + unzip 
        $ wget https://dtcenter.org/sites/default/files/comGSIv3.7_EnKFv1.3.tar.gz
        $ tar -xvf comGSIv3.7_EnKFv1.3.tar.gz 
Note the path to the unzipped folder. You will need it in the next step (path2GSI). 

# 3. Run 2_compile_GSI.sh
You will need to edit two file paths in this. This line:

        $ path2spack=/global/scratch/users/siennaw/gsi_2024/compiling/spack

and this line:

        $ path2GSI=/global/scratch/users/siennaw/gsi_2024/compiling/gsi4savio/GSIall

Submit this job to run with sbatch. If all goes well it takes ~ 5 minutes.

# 4. Compile WPS and WRF
WPS is a pre-processing utility for WRF, but I discovered that if you install WPS using spack it will install a version of WRF as well. Two for one! The script is pretty straightforward -- just submit it to sbatch. It will take maybe 15 minutes.

        $ sbatch 3_compile_WPS_and_WRF.sh

# 5. Set up your conda environment.
For this specific task, I recommend that you log into savio on the command line (not through open on-demand). For some reason, I've found through personal experience that the log-in nodes are wayyyy faster than anything you'll get through on demand for creating conda environments. This will save you a lot of time! 

Once you're on the log-in node, you can create the environment with the following:

        $ conda env create -f environment.yml

This will take maybe 45-50 minutes if you're lucky. Sorry. At least you only have to do it once! Once it's done, you'll have a conda environment called "smoke_env" with all the packages you need.
