# Compiling GSI 
last updated: Oct 28 2024

(1) Install a local version of spack. Clone the spack git directory into a nearby folder:
    $ git clone https://github.com/spack/spack
Note the path of this directory. You will assign it to the varible 
    $ path2spack=/global/scratch/users/siennaw/gsi_2024/compiling/spack
in the next two shell scripts. 

(2) Install needed libraries using spack. You should open this script and edit the path2spack mentioned above. You can either run the shell script 

        $ ./1_install_GSI_packages.sh 
or submit to to slurm with 
        $ sbatch 1_install_GSI_packages.sh
From what I can tell, this script takes maybe ~40ish min to run when I used sbatch.

#NO use your own installation

#START HERE to install NCEPLIBS which is needed by new version of GSI

#Try this instead to install a local version of spac.
